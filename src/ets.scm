;; When we want to execute the program, we have to replace cL by the
;; extracted program of its proof, and cGA by an assumed extracted term
;; to be provided by the user.  This can be achieved by adding
;; computation rules for cL and cGA.  We can be rather flexible here and
;; enable/block rewriting by using animate/deanimate as desired.

;; Notice that the type of the extracted term provided for a cGA must be
;; the et-type of the assumed formula.  When predicate variables are
;; present, one must use the type variables assigned to them in

;; However the idpc-pvar used locally in the stored clauses of an
;; idpredconst needs an mr-pvar where the realizer argument can have a

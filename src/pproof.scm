;; 11. Partial proofs
;; ==================

;; A partial proof is a proof with holes, i.e. special assumption
;; variables (called goal variables) ?_1, ?_2,... whose formulas must
;; be closed.  We assume that every goal variable ? has at most one
;; occurrence in the partial proof.  A goal is a (not necessarily
;; maximal) subproof ? x_1 ... x_n with distinct object or assumption
;; variables x_1...x_n, called its context.  Note that the goal
;; variable ? is not considered part of its context.  When
;; interactively developing a partial proof, a goal ? x_1...x_n is
;; replaced by another partial proof, with zero or more new goals
;; whose contexts are extensions of the original context x_1...x_n.
;; An object or assumption variable used later for allnc-intro or
;; impnc-intro is marked a n.c. variable in the goal.

;; To gain some flexibility when working on our goals, we do not at each
;; step of an interactive proof development traverse the partial proof
;; searching for the remaining goals, but rather keep a list of all open
;; goals together with their numbers as we go along.  We maintain a
;; global variable PPROOF-STATE, which holds a list of three elements:
;; - num-goals:
;;   an alist of entries (number goal drop-info hypname-info ignore-deco-flag)
;; - proof
;; - maxgoal

;; We include the context (for efficiency reasons) and also the ncvars
;; in a goal.

;; use-with is a more verbose form of use, where the terms are not
;; inferred via unification, but have to be given explicitly.  Also,
;; for the instantiated premises one can indicate how they are to come
;; about.  In the following definition of use-with x is one of the
;; following.

;; - A number or string identifying a hypothesis form the context.
;; - The name of a theorem or global assumption.  If it is a global
;;   assumption whose final conclusion is a nullary predicate variable
;;   distinct from bot (e.g. EfqLog or StabLog), this predicate variable
;;   is substituted by the goal formula.
;; - A closed proof.
;; - A formula with free variables from the context, generating a new goal.
;; Moreover x-list is a list consisting of
;; - a number or string identifying a hypothesis form the context,
;; - the name of a theorem or global assumption,
;; - a closed proof,
;; - the string "?" (value of DEFAULT-GOAL-NAME), generating a new goal,
;; - a symbol left or right,
;; - a term, whose free variables are added to the context,
;; - a type, which is substituted for the 1st tvar,
;; - a comprehension term, which is substituted for the 1st pvar.

;; Notice that new free variables not in the ordered context can be
;; introduced in use-with.  They will be present in the newly generated
;; num-goals.  The reason is that proofs should be allowed to contain free
;; variables.  This is necessary to allow logic in ground types where no
;; contant is available (e.g. to prove all x Px -> all x ~ Px -> F).

;; Recall that I rs provides

;; - the list rs of argument terms.

;; In (elim idhyp) idhyp is, with an inductively defined predicate I,
;; - a number or string identifying a hypothesis I rs form the context
;; - the name of a global assumption or theorem I rs;
;; - a closed proof of a formula I rs;
;; - a formula I rs with free variables from the context, generating a
;;   new goal.
;; Then the (strengthened) elimination axiom is used with rs for xs and
;; idhyp for I rs to prove the goal A(rs), leaving the instantiated
;; (with {xs|A(xs)}) clauses as new goals.

;; (elim) expects an inst-imp-formula I rs -> A(rs) as goal.  Then the
;; (strengthened) instantiated (with {xs|A(xs)}) clauses are new goals.

;; In case of simultaneously inductively defined predicate constants we
;; can provide other imp-formulas to be proved simultaneously with the
;; given one.  Then the (strengthened) simplified clauses are generated
;; as new goals.

;; In the following definition of inversion, x is one of the following.
;; - A number or string identifying a hypothesis I rs form the context.
;; - The name of a theorem or global assumption stating I rs
;; - A closed proof of I rs
;; - A formula I rs with free vars from the context, generating a new goal.

;; imp-formulas have the form J ss -> B.  Here I,J are inductively
;; defined predicates, with clauses K1 ... Kn.  One uses the elim-aconst
;; for I xs -> xs=rs -> goal and the additional implications J ys ->
;; ys=ss -> B, with ? ... ?  for the clauses, rs for xs and proofs for
;; rs=rs, to obtain the goal.  Then many of the generated goals for the
;; clauses will contain false premises, coming from substituted
;; equations xs=rs, and are proved automatically.

;; imp-formulas not provided are taken as J xs -> J xs.  Generated
;; clauses for such J are proved automatically from the intro axioms
;; (the rec-prems are not needed).

;; For simultaneous inductively defined predicates simplified-inversion
;; does not add imp-formulas J xs -> J xs to form the elim-aconst.
;; Then the (new) imp-formulas-to-uninst-elim-formulas-etc generates
;; simplified clauses.  In some special cases this suffices.

;; Now for coinduction (i.e., applications of the greatest fixed point
;; axioms Gfp).

;; Recall that J rs provides
;; - a type substitution,
;; - a predicate instantiation, and
;; - the list rs of argument terms.

;; (coind hyp) expects a goal J rs, with a coinductively defined
;; predicate J, and hyp is expected to be
;; - a number or string identifying a hypothesis A(rs) form the context;
;; - the name of a global assumption or theorem A(rs);
;; - a closed proof of a formula A(rs);
;; - a formula A(rs) with free variables from the context, generating a
;;   new goal.
;; (coind) expects an inst-imp-formula A(rs) -> J rs as goal.  Then the
;; Gfp axiom for J is used: P xs -> all xs(P xs -> C(P)) -> J xs with
;; C(J) the defining clause for J.  Substitute {xs|A(xs)} for P, and
;; use A(xs) -> all xs(A(xs) -> C({xs|A(xs)})) -> J xs (i.e., its
;; universal closure).  After an appropriate application (rs for xs) we
;; are left with a new goal saying that {xs|A(xs)} satisfies the
;; defining clause for J.

;; In case of simultaneous coinductively defined predicates we can
;; provide other imp-formulas to be proved simultaneously with the
;; given one.  Then their clauses are generated as new goals.

;; In the following definition of (simp opt-dir-or-x . x-and-xs-or-xs),
;; opt-dir is either the string "<-" or missing.  x is one of the following.
;; - A number or string identifying a hypothesis form the context.
;; - The name of a theorem or global assumption, but not one whose final
;;   conclusion is a predicate variable.
;; - A closed proof.
;; - A formula with free variables from the context, generating a new goal.
;; xs is a list consisting of symbols left or right, giving
;; directions in case the used formula contains conjunctions, and of
;; terms.  The universal quantifiers of the used formula are
;; instantiated with appropriate terms to match a part of the goal.
;; The terms provided are substituted for those variables that
;; cannot be inferred.  For the instantiated premises new goals are
;; created.  This generates a used formula, which is to be an atom,
;; a negated atom or (lhs eqd rhs).  If it as a (negated) atom,
;; check whether the kernel or its normal form is present in the
;; goal.  If so, replace it by True (False).  If it is (lhs = rhs)
;; or (lhs eqd rhs) with lhs or its normal form present in the goal,
;; replace lhs by rhs.  In case "<-" exchange lhs by rhs.

;; simp-with is a more verbose form of simp, where the terms are not
;; inferred via matching, but have to be given explicitly.  In fact,
;; simp is defined via simp-with.  In (simp-with opt-dir-or-x
;; . x-and-xs-or-xs), opt-dir and x are as in simp, except that the
;; formula of x must be an atom, a negated atom or (lhs eqd rhs).
;; xs is a list consisting of
;; - a number or string identifying a hypothesis form the context,
;; - the name of a theorem or global assumption,
;; - a closed proof,
;; - the string "?" (value of DEFAULT-GOAL-NAME), generating a new goal,
;; - a symbol left or right,
;; - a term, whose free variables are added to the context,
;; - a type, which is substituted for the 1st tvar,
;; - a comprehension term, which is substituted for the 1st pvar.

;; - the string "?" (value of DEFAULT-GOAL-NAME), generating a new goal,
;; - a symbol left or right,
;; - a term, whose free variables are added to the context,
;; - a type, which is substituted for the 1st tvar,
;; - a comprehension term, which is substituted for the 1st pvar.
;; This generates a used formula lhs==rhs with lhs or its normal form present

;; simphyp-with does for forward chaining the same as simp-with for

;; the definition below of simphyp-with hyp is one of the following.
;; - A number or string identifying a hypothesis form the context.
;; - The name of a theorem or global assumption, but not one whose final
;;   conclusion is a predicate variable.
;; - A closed proof.
;; - A formula with free variables from the context, generating a new goal.
;; Moreover xs is a list consisting of
;; - a number or string identifying a hypothesis form the context,
;; - the name of a theorem or global assumption,
;; - a closed proof,
;; - the string "?" (value of DEFAULT-GOAL-NAME), generating a new goal,
;; - a symbol left or right,
;; - a term, whose free variables are added to the context,
;; - a type, which is substituted for the 1st tvar,
;; - a comprehension term, which is substituted for the 1st pvar.

;; This generates a used formula, which is to be an atom, a negated
;; atom or (lhs eqd rhs).  If it as a (negated)
;; atom, check whether the kernel or its normal form is present in the
;; hyp.  If so, replace it by True (False).  If it is an equality (lhs

;; search
;; ======

;; Following Miller (J. Logic Computat. Vol 1, 1991) and Berger, work with
;; lists of sequents instead of single sequents; they all are Q-sequents
;; for the same prefix Q.  One then searches for a Q-substitution phi and
;; proofs of the phi-substituted sequents.  Intro-search takes the first
;; sequent and extends Q by all x1... .  It then calls select, which
;; selects (using or) a fitting clause.  If one is found, a new prefix Q'
;; (from raised-new-flex-vars) is formed, and the n (>= 0) new goals with
;; their clauses (and also all remaining sequents) are substituted with
;; raise o rho, where rho is the mgu.  For this constellation
;; intro-search is called again.  In case of success, one obtains a
;; Q'-substitution phi' and proofs on the phi' o raise o rho -substituted
;; new sequents.  Let phi := (raise o rho o phi') restricted Q_exists, and
;; take the first n proofs of these to build a proof of the phi-substituted
;; (first) sequent originally considered by intro-search.

;; Change to Miller and Berger: work with all ex all -prefixes instead of
;; using arbitrary prefixes.

;; Terminology:
;; elab-path   list of symbols 'left or 'right
;; elab-list   list of formulas, variables and symbols 'left or 'right
;; elim-list   list of formulas, terms and symbols 'left or 'right
;; elim-items  list of proofs, terms and symbols 'left or 'right
;; elims       either elim-list or elim-items

;; elab-paths are needed for search in case conjunctions are present.

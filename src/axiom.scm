;; 8. Assumption variables and axioms
;; ==================================
;; To be renamed into avars scheme, with the axioms section transferred
;; into the new aconst.scm (was globalas.scm)

;; 8-1. Assumption variables
;; =========================

;; Assumption variables are implemented as lists ('avar formula index name).

;; To make sure that assumption variables generated by the system are
;; different from all user introduced assumption variables, we maintain a
;; global counter MAXAVARINDEX.  Whenever the user introduces an
;; assumption variable, e.g. by (make-avar formula 27 ""), then MAXAVARINDEX
;; is incremented to at least 27.

(define MAXAVARINDEX -1)

;; Constructor, accessors and tests for assumption variables:

(define (make-avar formula index name)
  (set! MAXAVARINDEX (max index MAXAVARINDEX))
  (list 'avar formula index name))

(define avar-to-formula cadr)
(define avar-to-index caddr)
(define avar-to-name cadddr)

;; avar-form? moved next to compose-substitutions in typ.scm, where it
;; is used already.

;; (define (avar-form? x) (and (pair? x) (eq? 'avar (car x))))

(define (avar? x)
  (and (avar-form? x)
       (list? x)
       (= 4 (length x))
       (let ((formula (cadr x))
	     (index (caddr x))
	     (name (cadddr x)))
	 (and (formula? formula)
	      (<= -1 index)
	      (<= index MAXAVARINDEX)
	      (string? name)))))

(define (avar=? avar1 avar2)
  (or (eq? avar1 avar2)
      (and (avar-form? avar1) (avar-form? avar2)
	   (= (avar-to-index avar1) (avar-to-index avar2))

	(index (avar-to-index avar)))
    (string-append
     (if (string=? "" name) DEFAULT-AVAR-NAME name)
     (if (= -1 index) "" (number-to-string index)))))

;; renaming) we provide

;; 8-2. Assumption constants
;; =========================

;; An assumption constant appears in a proof, as an axiom, a theorem or
;; a global assumption.  Its formula is given as an "uninstantiated
;; formula", where only type and predicate variables can occur free;
;; these are considered to be bound in the assumption constant.  An
;; exception are the Elim and Gfp aconsts, where the argument variables
;; xs^ of the (co)inductively defined predicate are formally free in the
;; uninstantiated formula.  However, they are considered bound as well.
;; In the proof the bound type variables are implicitely instantiated
;; by types, and the bound predicate variables by cterms.  Since we do
;; not have type and predicate quantification in formulas, the aconst
;; contains these parts left implicit in the proof: tpsubst.

;; To normalize a proof we will first translate it into a term, then
;; normalize the term and finally translate the normal term back into a
;; proof.  To make this work, in case of axioms we pass to the term
;; appropriate "reproduction data" to be used when after normalization
;; the axiom in question is to be reconstructed: all-formulas for
;; induction, a number i and an inductively defined predicate constant
;; idpc for its ith clause, imp-formulas for elimination, an
;; existential formula for existence introduction, and an existential
;; formula together with a conclusion for existence elimination.
;; During normalization of the term these formulas are passed along.
;; When the normal form is reached, we have to translate back into a
;; proof.  Then these reproduction data are used to reconstruct the
;; axiom in question, via

;; all-formulas-to-ind-aconst
;; number-and-idpredconst-to-intro-aconst
;; imp-formulas-to-elim-aconst
;; all-formula-to-cases-aconst
;; ex-formula-to-ex-intro-aconst
;; ex-formula-and-concl-to-ex-elim-aconst

;; The reproduction data can be computed from the name, the
;; uninstantiated formula, the tpsubst of an axiom, by
;; aconst-to-computed-repro-data .  However, to avoid recomputations we
;; carry them along.

;; (i.e., projections) and the if-construct.  Terms always have the form
;; (tag type ...) where ... is a list with further information.

;; arguments, into the corresponding Scheme expression.  Example:
;; ((NatLe r1) r2) is transformed into (<= e1 e2).  If however c is
;; applied to fewer arguments, then the default translation of c is
;; used.  Example: (NatLe r1) is transformed into (|NatLe| e1).  To run
;; this expression one needs to define the default translation of c on
;; the Scheme level, in curried form.  Example: (define |NatLe| (lambda
;; (x) (lambda (y) (<= x y)))).  For the usual built-in operators this
;; can be done globally.  For constants occurring in a special example
;; it must be done locally.  Example: in the gcd example we have the
;; Step function.  The general term-to-external-expr produces (by
;; default) |Step|, and then in gcd.scm |Step| needs to be defined on
;; the Scheme level.  By default |Step| is treated as a curried
;; function.  However, with an optional argument '("Step" 4) in
;; term-to-external-expr one can enforce that |Step| is treated as a
;; function with four arguments.
;
;; Equality with name "=" requires a special treatment: if there are
;; exactly two arguments, it is transformed into an =-expression if the
;; type of = refers to a number type (nat, pos, int or rat), and to an
;; equal?-expression otherwise.  If it is applied to fewer arguments,
;; then one needs FinAlg= as a special default name, since the internal
;; name = cannot be used.
;
;; In term-to-external-expr, terms in numeric form wrt either pos or
;; nat are both displayed as the corresponding number.  Therefore both
;; is-numeric-term-wrt-pos? and is-numeric-term-wrt-nat? have been
;; moved here, and similarly numeric-term-wrt-pos-to-number and
;; numeric-term-wrt-nat-to-number.

;; This is possible because of Haskell's lazy evaluation, and gives
;; rise to a sound realizer, which in general is more efficent since
;; it is not calculating the measure function.  Note however that this
;; semantics is noticably different from Minlog's semantics, since
;; grec is a total function (by design), whereas grecNoMeasure is not
;; (e.g. measure m = id and g x h = h x -- notice that g is not only
;; doing recursive calls on smaller arguments).  However, every
;; instance of grecNoMeasure arising from an extracted proof will
;; terminate, as the proof is only using the induction hypothesis for
;; smaller terms, and the relation R(x, y) <=> m x < m y is
;; wellfounded.
;;
;; To summarise: if flag is set to true, the Haskell semantics is
;; exactly the same as the Minlog semantics.  If the flag is set to
;; false, a more efficient Haskell semantics is achieved, but with a
;; risk of non-termination if used incorrectly, that is trying to do
;; recursive calls on arguments that are not smaller according to the
;; measure.

;; 6-9. First and second order matching
;; ====================================

;; match checks whether a given pattern (term or formula with type
;; variables in its types) can be transformed by a tosubst - respecting
;; totality constraints - into a given instance, such that (1) no type
;; variable from a given set of identity variables (2) no object
;; variable from a given set of signature variables gets substituted.
;; It returns #f, if this is impossible, and the tosubst otherwise.

;; match-aux is an auxiliary function.  It takes a list of match
;; problems, i.e. lists of items (sig-tvars sig-vars pattern instance),
;; and the substitutions built so far.  It again returns #f or a
;; tosubst.

;; Example: pattern: [x]..x..n.., instance: [n]..n..m..  Then x is
;; renamed into x0 and we have a recursive call to match-aux with
;; pattern: ..x0..n.., instance: ..n..m.., tosubst: alpha -> nat, x0 ->
;; n.

;; 6-10. Pattern unification
;; =========================

;; A pattern (more precisely a higher order pattern) is an expression
;; (i.e. a term or a formula) in beta normal form with the property
;; that every ``flexible'' variable y occurs in a context yx1...xn with
;; distinct ``forbidden'' (for substitutions) variables x1...xn.
;; Forbidden variables are the ones bound further outside, or given
;; explicitly as forbidden.  Comments:
;; - yx1...xn need not be of ground type.
;; - eta-expansion of the xi is not allowed (for simplicity).

;; The main function pattern-unify implements in a slightly modified form
;; Miller's pattern unification algorithm from Miller (J. Logic Computat.
;; Vol. 1, 1991).  The modification consists in changing the order of
;; steps: raising is postponed until it is needed, to avoid unnecessary
;; creation of new variables.  It is obtained by iterating a one-step
;; function pattern-unify1, implementing the step from a state formula S
;; to either #f, indicating that there is no unifier, or else a pair
;; (rho, S') with a ``transition'' substitution rho.  A state formula S
;; consists of a prefix Q of the form all sig-vars ex flex-vars all
;; forb-vars, followed by a list of unification pairs.  All terms in this
;; list are patterns w.r.t. Q.  We call

;; - sig-vars the signature variables (to avoid unnecessary renaming),

;; - flex-vars the flexible variables (to be substituted),

;; - forb-vars the forbidden variables (not allowed in substitution terms).

;; The domain of rho consists of flexible variables from S only, and its
;; value terms never contain a forbidden variable (of either S or S')
;; free.  Moreover, rho is idempotent.  pattern-unify1 satifies the
;; following property.  Assume (pattern-unify1 S) = (rho S').  Then for
;; every S'-solution phi', (rho composed phi')restricted Q_exists is an
;; S-solution, and every S-solution can be obtained in this way.

;; pattern-unify-flex-flex checks whether both heads are flexible.

;; Case 1.  If the heads are equal, the pointwise intersection new-vars
;; of the argument vars is formed.  Then a new variable y' is formed and
;; the new term lambda vars (y' new-vars) is substituted for the flexible
;; variables.  This substitution must also be carried out in
;; rest-unif-pairs. Then a beta0 normalization is done (beta0 because the
;; special form of patterns implies that no new redexes are generated by
;; the beta conversion).  With the result pattern-unify-equality is called.

;; Case 2.  If the heads are different, first check whether one list of
;; argument variables is contained in the other.  If so, the head of the
;; term with more variables is substituted accordingly.  If not, the
;; intersection of the argument variables is computed, a new variable of
;; the corresponding type is formed and both heads are substituted with
;; the new term formed from it.  Then one proceeds as before.  (Note that
;; the check whether one argument list is contained in the other is only
;; done to avoid unneccessary substitution of variables: in this case we
;; can keep the variable with fewer arguments).

;; Otherwise pattern-unify-by-occurs-check-and-pruning is called.

;; 6-11. Huets unification algorithm
;; =================================

;; Huets unification algorithm needs: simpl, match.  simpl needs
;; rigid heads and decomposes the problem to the arguments.  A term is
;; rigid if its head is either a constant or a bound variable.

;; match gets a flexible and a rigid argument.  It consists of two
;; parts: imitation and projections.

;; Imitation gets f r1 ... rm and A s1 ... sn as arguments.  It
;; produces a substitution, for the flexible head f: f mapsto
;; lambda_xs(A(hs xs)).  This only works if A is a constant.

;; Projection gets f r1 ... rm and A s1 ... sn as arguments.  There are
;; m projections;; each of these pulls one of the rs in front.  So the
;; i-th projection maps f to lambda_{x1...xm}(xi (hs xs)), where the
;; types are as follows: Let beta_i = alpha_{i1} => ... => alpha{i k_i}
;; => iota.  f : beta_1 => ... => beta_m => iota.  ri, xi : beta_i.  hj
;; : beta_1 => ... => beta_m => alpha_{i j}.

;; Notice that for matching f r1 ... rm and A s1 ... sn, up to one
;; imitation and m projections is possible.

;; Organization: Work with lists of unification pairs.  Take the first
;; one, say (r s).  First simp decomposes the structure if possible, or
;; stops with failure.  Then match gets a flex rigid pair.  It calls
;; imitate and then all projections.  For each answer it gets it
;; produces a new unification problem by applying the substitution to
;; all unif-pairs.  Then it recursively calls simpl for each of these,
;; and generates a "match tree" in this way.  The subsitution needs to
;; be carried along (on each path separately), which will finally yield
;; the desired unifier.

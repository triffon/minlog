;; Proofs are built from assumption variables and assumption constants
;; (i.e., axioms, theorems and global assumptions) by the usual rules of
;; natural deduction, i.e., introduction and elimination rules for
;; implication, conjunction and universal quantification.  From a proof
;; we can read off its context, which is an ordered list of object and
;; assumption variables.

;; 10-2. Normalization by evaluation
;; =================================

;; Normalization of proofs will be done by reduction to normalization of
;; terms.  (1) Construct a term from the proof.  To do this properly,
;; create for every free avar in the given proof a new var whose type
;; comes from the formula of the avar.  Store this information.  Note
;; that in this construction one also has to first create new vars for
;; the bound avars.  Similary to avars we have to treat assumption
;; constants which are not axioms, i.e., theorems or global assumptions.
;; (2) Normalize the resulting term.  (3) Reconstruct a normal proof from
;; this term, the end formula and the stored information.  - The critical
;; variables are carried along for efficiency reasons.

;; To assign recursion constants to induction constants, we need to
;; associate type variables with predicate variables, in such a way
;; that we can later refer to this assignment.  Therefore we use a
;; global variable PVAR-TO-TVAR-ALIST, which memorizes the assigment
;; done so far.  A fixed PVAR-TO-TVAR refers to and updates
;; PVAR-TO-TVAR-ALIST.

;; For term extraction, in particular in formula-to-et-type and
;; formula-to-etd-types, we will also need to assign type variables to
;; predicate variables, this time only for those with positive or
;; negative computational content.  There we will also refer to the
;; same PVAR-TO-TVAR and PVAR-TO-TVARP and PVAR-TO-TVARN.  Later
;; reference is necessary, because such tvars will appear in extracted
;; terms of theorems involving pvars, and in a given development there
;; may be many auxiliary lemmata containing the same pvar.  In a
;; finished development with no free pvars left PVAR-TO-TVAR
;; PVAR-TO-TVARP and PVAR-TO-TVARN are not relevant any more, because
;; all pvars (in aconsts or idpcs) are bound.  In an unfinished
;; development we want to assign the same tvar to all occurrences of a
;; pvar, and it does not matter which tvar it is.

;; Example Id: all alpha, beta all P^(alpha=>prop+beta).  P^ -> P^ has
;; [beta][y]y as extracted term.  The tvar beta disappears as soon as
;; Id is applied to some cterm without pvars.

;; Given a proof and suppose we want to extract its content.  Then we
;; can concentrate on its computationally relevant parts, and replace
;; the rest by newly introduced assumption variables.  This is useful
;; for efficiency reasons when normalizing, and also for studying the
;; need and the effect of pi-normalization, simplification and pruning.

;; Probably PVAR-TO-TVARP is not necessary.  PVAR-TO-TVAR should suffice.

;; PVAR-TO-TVAR-ALIST initially has
;; (Pvar alpha) -> gamma
;; Pvar2 -> beta2
;; Pvar1 -> beta1
;; Pvar  -> beta

;; rename-bound-avars replaces all bound avars by new ones with the
;; same name but a new index.  Properties: (i) rename-bound-avars
;; transforms a proof satisfying the avar convention w.r.t. its free
;; avars into a proof satisfying the avar convention completely.  (ii)
;; In every subproof of the result no free avar occurs (w.r.t. avar=?)
;; bound as well.  Property (ii) is assumed in proof-substitute.

;; A$ into a minimal logic derivation $\vdash A^g$.  In particular, for
;; every assumption constant $C$ used in the given derivation we have to
;; provide a derivation of $C^g$.  Now for some formulas $S$ -- the
;; so-called spreading formulas -- this is immediate, for we can derive
;; $S \to S^g$, and hence can use the original assumption constant.

;; In order to obtain a derivation of $C^g$ for $C$ an assumption
;; constant it suffices to know that its uninstantiated formula $S$ is
;; spreading, for then we generally have $\vdash S[\vec{A}^g] \to
;; S[\vec{A}]^g$ and hence can use the same assumption constant with a
;; different substitution.

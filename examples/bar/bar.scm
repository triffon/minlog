;; Based on Monika Seisenberger's Thesis "On the Constructive Content
;; of Proofs", LMU 2003

;; This file contains the definition of the inductive predicate Bar and
;; examples for the use of the introduction and elimination axioms.

;; We prove 
;; - Bar [] implies that every infinite sequence has a good initial segment.
;; - Bar ws*[].

;; We will make use of these two Lemmas in higman-finite.scm.
;; Therefore, we prove the statements for an alphabet consisting of
;; natural numbers.

;; list.scm introduces the algebra of lists with the constructors Nil
;; and Cons.  (Cons w ws) is displayed as w::ws.  The length of a list
;; is denoted by Lh.
